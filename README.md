# cutting_edge_technology_for_maximum_unsupported_span
This is a cutting edge technology that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence in 

the optimum predictiton of the maximum unsupported span for a small scale artisinal mine

The system is a multi-modal system that uses several regression and classification algorithms 

to walk its way through the training of the sub-models.

For each algorithms used in the training and testing of the sub-models, the one with the highest performace in terms 

of accuracy, precission, recall and f1 score are then saved to be connected to an API designed using html frameworks (materialize and bootstrap),

javascript and/or python.
